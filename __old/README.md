# ryanfiller.com

This is my personal portfolio site and blog. It's way over engineered for just a blog that parses markdown files and serves images, but hey, I want to show off my ability to code, too.

## Installing

Clone the repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ryanfiller/portfolio-svelte.git ryansite
```

This site uses [git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to store images, so if you want those you'll also need to run

```shell
git lfs get
```

Install dependencies

```shell
cd ryansite
yarn install
```

## I like Svelte!

This site is built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) & [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

Navigate into this site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

```shell
npm run start
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`!

## I like testing!

This site uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) with several accessibility extensions. To run basic tests

```shell
npm run test
```

See my testing setup [here](https://github.com/ryanfiller/portfolio-svelte/tree/main/cypress)

## I like Netlify!

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2a2468bd-7002-493e-a56d-1ddc2ffd2efc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ryanfiller-svelte/deploys)

I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting and [Netlify Large Media](https://www.netlify.com/products/large-media/) as my image transformer and CDN.

## I like Your Privacy!
This site contains no invasive analtyics tracking. It uses  [Netlify Analytics](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/) on the site to anonymously track how many server requests are made, and [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) to see what browsers and screen sizes people are using.

## Roadmap

See my planned features / known bugs [here](https://github.com/ryanfiller/portfolio-svelte/projects/1).
I also keep a pretty up to date change log [here](http://ryanfiller.com/changes)
