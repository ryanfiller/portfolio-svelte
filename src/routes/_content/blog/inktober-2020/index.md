      alt: 'mouse, from Maus illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-06-rodent.jpg',
      caption: `10/06/31 - I read Art Spiegelman’s "Maus" in college and really need to read it again. I grew up in a half Jewish family regularly watching the Fievel movies, so the metaphor of mice has always kind of been around, but this book really stuck with me. Especially the way he drew the eyes.`

      alt: 'Dracula illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-07-fancy.jpg',

      src: '/images/inktober-2020-10-hope.jpg',
      caption: `10/10/31 - On his planet, the S means Hope. What a dumb line in an otherwise alright move. I started reading comics in the 90s when Superman had a mullet for some reason, and I didn’t hate it.`

      alt: 'Hellboy illustration',

      alt: 'a worm from Dune illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-13-dune.jpg',
      caption: `10/13/31 - I’ve wanted to read Dune for a long time and never did until I heard there was a new movie coming out. I just got to the part where they see a worm for the first time. It’s pretty good.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Armor',
      alt: 'Samus Aran illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-14-armor.jpg',
      caption: `10/14/31 - Samus, the best power armor around. Metroid Prime is possibly my favorite game of all time, and my very favorite moment is the first time you see Samus’s eyes reflected back in her visor.`

      title: 'Outpost',
      alt: 'World of Warcraft Troll riding a raptor illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-15-outpost.jpg',
      caption: `10/15/31 - I really had fun that summer my wifre got really into World of Warcraft. That one outpost was like constantly under attack by the Alliance. No ink again.`

      alt: 'Darth Vader and Boba Fett having dinner illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-18-trap.jpg',
      caption: `10/18/31 - This is unironically my favorite scene in Star Wars, but the longer I drew it the more ridiculous I realized it was. They (knew each other as children in the prequels?) threw a dinner party for Leia and her friends. Were they going to eat? They have helmets.`

      title: 'Sleep',
      alt: 'Morpheus from The Matrix illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-21-sleep.jpg',
      caption: `10/21/31 - Morpheus, but not that Morpheus. Morpheus is my favorite Matrix character and there are so many iconic scenes it was hard to pick just one. This is the best one though.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Chef',
      alt: 'illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-22-chef.jpg',
      caption: `10/22/31 - I didn’t really like cooking all that much in Breathe of the Wild, but I did like eating. Dear people with a consistent style, what is that like? It’s like I learned how to draw link when I was 11 and now brain permanently thinks "yes, he is an anime character." Just pencil lines this time again.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Rip',
      alt: 'Bruce Wayne at a gravestone illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-23-rip.jpg',
      caption: `10/23/31 - I guess people were reading this one as R.I.P. and drawing tombstones? Anyways... My favorite scene from my favorite Batman movie. "I need it to be different now. I know I made a promise, but I didn't see this coming. I didn't count on being happy."`

    {
      title: 'Dig',
      alt: 'Scavenger the Transformer illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-24-dig.jpg',
      caption: `10/24/31 - When I was four my parents drove all over Texas to get me all six of the G1 Constructicons that built Devastator. Scavenger, the backhoe, was always my favorite because of his tank legs. Also my favorite construction equipment maybe? No ink.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Buddy',
      alt: 'Falco from Star Fox in a an Arwing illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-25-buddy.jpg',
      caption: `10/25/31 - "I ain’t your buddy! Go away!" Does anyone else have every single voice line from Star Fox 64 permanently taking up space in their brain?`
    },
    {
      title: 'Hide',
      alt: 'Predator illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-26-hide.jpg',
      caption: `10/26/31 - I wasn’t really feeling drawing tonight so I was like "Oh, I’ll draw something half invisible." One. Entire. Jungle. Background. Later...`

      alt: 'stylized illustration of Picard, Data, and Riker from Star Trek playing music',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-27-music.jpg',

      alt: 'The Floating Content from FFVI illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-28-float.jpg',
      caption: `10/28/31 - The Floating Continent from Final Fantasy VI. You should always wait for Shadow to jump off the edge.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Shoes',
      alt: 'Wicked Witch of the East holding shoes illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-29-shoes.jpg',
      caption: `10/29/31 - I guess this is the Wicked Witch of the East before Dorothy dropped a house on her? Just an excuse to draw more creepy hands, really.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Ominous',
      alt: 'Gengar Pokemon illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-30-ominous.jpg',
      caption: `10/30/31 - Like I was going to go the whole month without drawing a Pokémon. This one is brought to you by two misconceptions I had - that an attack called Ominous Stare existed, and that Gengar could learn it.`
    },
    {
      title: 'Crawl',
      alt: 'black suit Spider-Man illustration',
      src: '/images/inktober-2020-31-crawl.jpg',
      caption: `10/31/31 - I think this might be the first time in my entire life I’ve ever drawn black suit Spider-Man. Weird.`

## Drawing 31 Things in 31 Days

This was the first year I had the perseverance to finish all 31 drawings for [#Inktober](https://inktober.com/rules). They're not all the best drawings I've ever done in my life, but I am very proud of making it all the way through this year. I thought it might be fun to post all my drawings outside of only on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ryanfiller_/).
